# Customer Data Cleaning & World Population Exploration Using Pandas

In this project, I worked with customer datasets and demographic data to clean and analyze global trends. The focus was on improving data quality and exploring population growth patterns worldwide using Python's data analysis and visualization libraries.



## Key Responsibilities:

- Data Cleaning & Standardization: Cleaned and standardized customer information, resolving missing values, handling outliers, and ensuring dataset consistency.
- Global Population Analysis: Analyzed demographic data to explore population growth trends across different continents.
- Data Visualization: Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations highlighting key insights into population distributions and demographic shifts.
